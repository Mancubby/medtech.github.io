<p class="p1header"><h2>Missing Spider Report</h2></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-indent:50px;">It brings great sorrow to me to say that our beloved class spider, Stanley, has gone missing. Stanley is about 1cm around, and is a dark brown/black color. He likes webs and staying by windows. If you see him, please bring him back to his home outside of our classroom window by Amber's desk. He has a short-term memory and forgets his way home sometimes. He may look intimidating but he is really quite shy and friendly. Updates on this tragic situation will provided here at a later date. Thank you. <br>
