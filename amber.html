<h2>Ben Tyler Cook in Society</h2>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 50px;" class="p1">
Ben Tyler Cook must be protected at all cost. 
He is a smol bean. He is a precious human being. 
He can act, sing, and dance without even trying. 
He is a goregous human being.
We must also protect his friends as they are smol beans also (like Josh Burrage).
